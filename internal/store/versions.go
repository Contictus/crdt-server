// Version history answers the question the rest of this store cannot: not "what
// does the document say" but "what did it say yesterday, before somebody
// pasted over it". Nothing else in the server can answer it - a CRDT update log
// is a record of what was added, and compaction folds it away by design.
//
// A version is a complete document rather than a diff from the version before
// it. A chain would be smaller, and would make reading one version a walk
// through every version before it, with no way to drop an old one - which is
// the only operation retention consists of. What keeps the size honest is that
// a version is written only when it differs from the newest one, so a document
// nobody edited produces one row however long the timer runs.

// ErrNoVersion means the version asked for is not there, or belongs to another
// document.
var ErrNoVersion = errors.New("store: no such version")

// A Version is one stored state of a document.
type Version struct {
	// ID orders versions within a document; it is what a caller asks for.
	ID int64
	// CreatedAt is when it was taken.
	CreatedAt time.Time
	// StateVector is the document's version at that moment. It is the same
	// bytes the read API returns as an ETag, so a caller can tell whether a
	// version matches what it already has without downloading it.
	StateVector []byte
	// Label is empty for the versions the timer took, and whatever the caller
	// said for the ones taken by hand.
	Label string
	// Bytes is the size of Payload. On a listing, where Payload is not read,
	// it is the *stored* size, which is what the version costs and may be
	// smaller than the document it holds; on a load it is the document.
	Bytes int
	// Payload is the whole document as a Yjs update. Nil on listings: a list of
	// twenty versions of a megabyte document is not a listing.
	Payload []byte
}

// SaveVersion stores a version, unless one would say nothing new.
//
// Two conditions, both there because every replica holding a document runs its
// own timer:
//
//   - nothing is written when a version newer than minAge already exists, so
//     three replicas on the same document produce one version per interval
//     rather than three;
//   - nothing is written when the newest version has the same state vector, so
//     a document nobody is editing does not accumulate identical copies.
//
// The advisory lock is what makes those hold between replicas, and it is not
// decoration. `INSERT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS` looks atomic and is not: under READ
// COMMITTED two concurrent statements each evaluate the subquery against their
// own snapshot, neither sees the other's uncommitted row, and both insert.
// Demonstrated against this schema with two sessions, which produced two rows.
//
// The damage was not corruption but retention: duplicates eat the budget, so
// "keep the last 24" on a three-replica cluster silently becomes "keep the last
// eight moments". Compact takes the same lock, for the same reason (C2, C6).
//
// It reports whether a row was written.
