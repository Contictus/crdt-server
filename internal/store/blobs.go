package store

// Putting the big blobs somewhere other than PostgreSQL.
//
// Two columns decide where each blob is, per row: an empty key means the bytes
// are in the BYTEA column next to it, and a non-empty key means they are an
// object. So a database can hold both at once. Turning object storage on
// migrates nothing and reads what is already there; turning it off leaves the
// objects readable, because the rows still name them.
//
// # The order of operations, which is the whole of the correctness argument
//
// Writing: the object first, then the row. If the object lands and the row does
// not, the object is an orphan - wasted storage, and nothing else. If the row
// landed first and the object did not, the row would point at nothing, which is
// a document that cannot be read. One of those is a bill and the other is data
// loss.
//
// Deleting: the row first, then the object. Same argument in reverse. A row
// deleted whose object survives is an orphan; an object deleted whose row
// survives is a version that has quietly become unreadable.
//
// Orphans are therefore possible by design, and only from a failure in between.
// They are bounded - a snapshot key contains its sequence number and a version
// key is written once - so nothing accumulates during normal running.
