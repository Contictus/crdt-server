// What a room that outlived the document it was serving can do to the database.
//
// Deleting a document while another replica still holds it in memory is a real
// sequence: DELETE evicts the room on the replica that served the request and
// nothing tells the others. The question this answers is what the surviving
// room's next write does - and the answer is nothing, because both write paths
// need the row that was deleted. Append's foreign key has no parent, and
// Compact only ever updates a row it expects to find.
//
// That is worth a test rather than an argument, because it is the difference
// between "the deletion held" and "the document came back with its contents".
