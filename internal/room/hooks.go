// Hook events are coalesced rather than sent per update. A person typing
// produces tens of updates a second and a webhook per keystroke is not a
// feature, it is an outage at the receiving end. The room therefore records
// that something happened and emits at most one event per tick, which costs a
// bool on the hot path and nothing else - no second timer per document, and no
// work at all in a server with no hooks configured.
//
// The consequence to know about is that the delay between an edit and its
// webhook is bounded by -tick, not by a knob of its own. Lowering -tick lowers
// it; the tick's other jobs, sweeping awareness and checking idleness, do not
// mind being done more often.

// hooksEnabled reports whether anything is listening. Every call site is behind
// it, so a server without hooks does not encode a state vector on every tick.
