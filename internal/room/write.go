// Merging an update into a document from outside the WebSocket is how a
// document is restored from a backup, or seeded from a template.
//
// It is a merge and not a replace, and the name says so. These are CRDT
// updates: applying one adds what it contains to what is already there. There
// is no operation that makes a document forget something, because the format
// has none - deleting is itself an update that says what was deleted. Restoring
// over a document that has moved on therefore gives the union, not the backup.
// The runbook says to delete first when that is not what you want.
