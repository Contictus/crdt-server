// Package metrics is the server's Prometheus instrumentation.
//
// It is one struct rather than a set of package-level variables, and it is
// passed to the packages that report into it. That costs a field in two configs
// and buys two things: a test can build a fresh set against its own registry
// and assert on what was recorded, and Nop exists, so no caller ever has to
// check for nil before counting something.
//
// What is measured is what a person on call would ask about: how many
// connections and rooms there are, how long integrating an update takes, how
// long the database takes, and what the server is refusing. Everything else is
// noise that costs cardinality.
