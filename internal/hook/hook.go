// Package hook reports what happened to a document to something outside this

// one, and cannot make a room wait: a document that stops accepting keystrokes
// because somebody's webhook receiver is slow is a worse outcome than a missed
// notification, every time. Delivery is therefore best effort, and the events
// say so - they carry a timestamp and a state vector so a receiver that missed
// one can tell, and read the document back over the admin API if it cares.
